# VARIABLES
# ===========================================
# Python is a "type-inferred" language :
# you don't have to explicitly define the variable type

# Declare and assign value
website = "apple.com"
# print(website)

website = "powercoders.org"
# print(website)


# Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello!"
print(b)


# Assign the same value for multiple variables
a = b = c = 8
